This is a brief description of the TUXEDO Simple Application.
A more comprehensive look can be found in the TUXEDO System
Application Development Guide.

The Simple Application consists of a single server offering a single
service.  The service is called TOUPPER.  The client is run with
a single argument, which is a string to convert to upper case.
The client calls the service, which returns the converted string.
The client then prints that string.

Example: simpcl "Hello World"

Returned string is: HELLO WORLD

This application runs a single server on a single machine.  It is
designed so that it can be up and running within minutes after
installing the TUXEDO software.

You should probably copy the simpapp files to your own directory,
since the configuration file must be edited and you might also
want to experiment with the client and server code.

You need to set several environment variables before using
TUXEDO or running any TUXEDO application:

	TUXDIR - base directory of the TUXEDO software
	APPDIR - base directory of the sample program
	PATH - must include %TUXDIR%\bin
	TUXCONFIG - full pathname of binary tuxconfig file
	WSNADDR - This is only needed on workstation clients. Refer to the
	Workstation Documentation or the WSL man page for the format of the 
	address.

Edit the script setenv.cmd, which sets all of these variables.

The sample configuration file, ubbsimple, must be edited to replace
the bracketed items with values appropriate to your installation.
Your TUXDIR and TUXCONFIG environment variables must match the
values in the configuration file. At this point you should build the 
server and client executables using simpapp.nt.

After editing ubbsimple, create the binary TUXCONFIG file with the command:

	tmloadcf ubbsimple
	(Answer "y" if it asks you whether it should proceed)


You can build the server and client executables using the makefile simpapp.nt.
An alternative way to do this is as follows:

	buildclient -o simpcl -f simpcl.c
	buildserver -o simpserv -f simpserv.c -s TOUPPER

The Simple Application can be booted with the command:

	tmboot -y

Then you can run "simpcl" as shown in the example above.
Simpcl can be run as many times as you wish.

When you are done, you can shut down the Simple Application with
the command:

	tmshutdown -y

Suggested next steps:

	Run more than one copy of the "simpserv" server, all operating
	from a single queue (Hint: See the RQADDR parameter in ubbconfig 
	man page).

	Configure a networked application, where the client and server
	run on different machines.

	Try the administrative command, "tmadmin", to display and
	modify the parameters of the running application.  (Try
	suspending the TOUPPER service, and then running the client.)
